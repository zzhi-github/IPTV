# IPTV
The project just provides a very simple way to watch live TV stream on the broswer.
The html can run in macOS Safari smoothly (unfortunately edge, chrome and firefox won't work due to lacking HLS stream playing capabilty), it has a simple menu to list all the TV stations.
You can click the TV station name and watch the TV online. 
That's all!

The html was generated by openAI via New Bing and ChatGPT, I'm not a web developer. 
It's very interesting to demostrate how AI can help the human beings to archieve a 'hard' task. 

(I may continue to polish the html in future, like make the menu transparent over the video so that I can see the video in the entire page.)

Now there are two versions: 
IPTV by NewBing: It's the first version, the layout is simple that video is on the left, and TV menu is always on the right. The TV stations will be loaded when the page is opened, you can select one TV station to play.
IPTVSideNav: It's the second version, the layout is much simpler than first version. The video occupies the entire page and the TV menu will be displayed by clicking the texts 'TV Menu' on demand. The menu will be over the video and all TV stations are display on the transparent backgroud. The menu effection looks much better in this version. Also, the refresh button is added to reload the menu if needed. 

The screenshots are available. 

Have a good day!
