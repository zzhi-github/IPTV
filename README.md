# IPTV
The project just provides a very simple way to watch live TV stream on the broswer.
The html can run in macOS Safari, it has a simple menu to list all the TV stations on the right.
You can click the TV station name and watch the TV online. 
That's all

The html was generated by openAI via New Bing and ChatGPT, I'm not a web developer. 
It's very interesting to demostrate how AI can help the buman beings to archieve a 'hard' task. 

I may continue to polish the html in future, like make the menu transparent over the video so that I can see the video in the entire page.

Have a good day!
